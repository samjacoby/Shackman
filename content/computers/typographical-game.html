Wearied by my own woefully inadequate ability to spot the difference between say a Bembo 'I' and a Dante 'I', I devised this [little game](http://shackmanpress.com/typefaces) to train myself.

Here's a picture, but you should just play for yourself. It's solid medium-fun, depending on how into typefaces you are.
