Learning German is hard. It is hard and it is not fun. Twain got that like no other. This essay, originally an appendix in _The Tramps Abroad_, details the trials and trevails of trying to master _Duetsch_, and was a great solace to me while attempting to do the same. Be forewarned: it is _not_ funny if you haven't tried to learn German. It is belly-achingly so if you have.
